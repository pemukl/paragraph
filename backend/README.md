# paraback

backend parsing and linking laws

## Getting Started

To set up your local development environment, please run:

    poetry install

Behind the scenes, this creates a virtual environment and installs `paraback` along with its dependencies into a new virtualenv.
Whenever you run `poetry run <command>`, that `<command>` is actually run inside the virtualenv managed by poetry.

You can now access the CLI with `poetry run python -m paraback`.

If you want to deploy this project as a docker container, please ensure that [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) are installed, then run

    docker-compose up

this will build the entire project with all dependencies inside a docker container. You may use the command line interface of the application now, e.g. by editing the `command` tag in the [`docker-compose.yml`](./docker-compose.yml).

### Testing

We use `pytest` as test framework. To execute the tests, please run

    pytest tests

To run the tests with coverage information, please use

    pytest tests --cov=src --cov-report=html --cov-report=term

and have a look at the `htmlcov` folder, after the tests are done.

### Distribution Package

To build a distribution package (wheel), please use

    python setup.py bdist_wheel

this will clean up the build folder and then run the `bdist_wheel` command.

### Contributions

Before contributing, please set up the pre-commit hooks to reduce errors and ensure consistency

    pip install -U pre-commit

    pre-commit install

If you run into any issues, you can remove the hooks again with `pre-commit uninstall`.
